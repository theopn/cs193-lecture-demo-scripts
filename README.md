# CS193 Lecture Demo Scripts

CS193: Tools is a Purdue University [CS course](https://selfservice.mypurdue.purdue.edu/prod/bzwsrch.p_catalog_detail?term=202320&subject=CS&cnbr=19300&enhanced=Y) designed to teach CS/DS/AI freshmen essential development tools such as UNIX shells, debugging tools, and Git.

You can find resources I used for demos in lectures while working as an instructor for two semesters. Future instructors are welcome to use this repository.
